# data-science-world

This is meant to be a showcase of stuff I'm playing around with, struggling with or obsessing about.  
Its arranged as follows : 
1. Entire projects are in the **Projects** folder. My attempt here is to try to answer as many questions as I can. Ideally it would try spanning the entire data science pipeline, from data  to data product. These folders include
    * Data stories ( in the README.mds)
    * Data analyses 
    * Machine Learning Prediction algorithms 
    * Dashboards 
    * the data used for all these analyses (unless its sensitive data)
2. One of analyses usually demonstrating a quick demo of a library, technique or concept. Some are complete, some ...meh!
