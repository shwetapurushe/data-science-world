# data-science-world

This is meant to be a showcase of stuff I'm playing around with, struggling with or obsessing about.  
Its arranged as follows : 
1. Entire projects are in the **Projects** folder. My attempt here is to try to answer as many questions as I can. Ideally it would try spanning the entire data science pipeline, from data  to data product. These folders include
    * Data stories ( in the README.mds)
    * Data analyses 
    * Machine Learning Prediction algorithms 
    * Dashboards 
    * the data used for all these analyses (unless its sensitive data)
2. One-off analyses usually demonstrating a quick demo of a library, technique or concept. 
    * If the goal of the notebook is to explain a technique, then the choice of data is deliberately simple (for e.g. iris, cars). I feel this prevents focus on the data and enables the reader to 
focus on the technique.  
    * Some are complete, some ...meh!

<font color=GREEN>To-Dos in green. Ill try revisiting whenever i can.</font>
Please remember that most of the projects are work in progress(w.i.p) unless specified so..**because a data science project never ends** (err....also I work on these during off hours and when Im not day dreaming.)
