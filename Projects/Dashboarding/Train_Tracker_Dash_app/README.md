## Inspiration for this project
I had signed up for alert messages from the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority, to alert me about train delays, service repairs and emergency change in schedules.  
My commute is a whopping 1.5 hours one way, so before I signed up for these messages, I had many "Crap!!" moments which totally could have been avoided.  
  
And now that I had soooo many alert messages (during my commute and surrounding 1-2 peak hours) I thought could I use these messages to _quantify_ how good or bad my commuter rail was ?

So I did the following:
* Collected messages for a given period of time ( I update this data history on the app).
* Transferred these messages to my computer using this software called [iMazing](https://imazing.com/). 
* Analyzed the data 
* Created a web app using [Dash](https://plot.ly/products/dash/).
