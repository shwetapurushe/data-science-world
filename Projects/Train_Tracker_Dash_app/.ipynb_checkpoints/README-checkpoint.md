## Inspiration for this project
I had signed up for alert messages from the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority, to alert me about train delays, service repairs and emergency change in schedules.  
My commute is a whopping 1.5 hours one way, so before I signed up for these messages, I had many "Crap!!" moments which totally could have been avoided.  
  
And now that I had soooo many alert messages (during my commute and surrounding 1-2 peak hours) I thought could I use these messages to _Quantify_ how good or bad my commuter rail was ?
